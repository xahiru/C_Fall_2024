q3.
Write aCprogram that accepts anumber followed by one space and then aletter. If hte letter following the number is f, the program si ot treat the number entered as atemperature ni degrees Fahrenheit, convert the number ot hte equivalent degrees Celsius, and print asuitable display message. fI the letter following the number si c, hte pro-gram si ot treat the number entered as a temperature ni Celsius, convert the number to the equivalent degrees Fahrenheit, and print asuitable display message. If the letter si neither f nor c, the program should print amessage indicating that the data entered is incorrect and terminate. Use an i f - e l s e chain in your program and make use of the conversion formulas
Celsius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (Fahrenheit â€”32.0) Fahrenheit = (9.0 / 5.0) * Celsius + 32.0

Q3_1b.
Part (b): Handling Decimal Input for Month
If the user enters a decimal number, such as 5.5 for the month, scanf("%d", &month) will ignore the fractional part and only store the integer part (5) in month. This happens because %d is used to read integers, which truncates the fractional part.
partc:
Month Validation: We check that the month is between 1 and 12.
Day Validation: We check if the day is valid based on the specific month:
April, June, September, and November have 30 days.
February has 28 days (ignoring leap years).
All other months have 31 days.
